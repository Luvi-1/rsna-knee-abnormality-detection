# Decisions

## D-001 - Kaggle-heavy execution

- Date: 2026-08-07
- Owner: Luvi-1 and Codex
- Question: Where should full-data processing run?
- Alternatives: local MacBook; Kaggle; another cloud.
- Evidence: live data size is 569.76 GB and 819,640 files; final inference must run in an offline Kaggle Notebook within nine hours.
- Decision: keep full data, training, and inference on Kaggle; use the Mac for code, public metadata, aggregates, and synthetic tests.
- Risks: notebook quotas and environment drift.
- Reversal condition: a rule-compliant private environment is approved and offers a measurable advantage.
- Commit/experiment: `fdd9769`; no experiment.

## D-002 - Contract before modeling

- Date: 2026-08-07
- Owner: Luvi-1 and Codex
- Question: Start modeling or establish governance first?
- Alternatives: rapid notebook baseline; governed bootstrap.
- Evidence: binding MIRA, private-sharing, external-asset, runtime, and winner-delivery constraints affect architecture and data handling.
- Decision: complete the live contract and governance baseline first.
- Risks: delays first baseline by one small chunk.
- Reversal condition: none; the contract remains mandatory.
- Commit/experiment: `fdd9769`; no experiment.

## D-003 - Unknown labels remain masked

- Date: 2026-08-07
- Owner: Luvi-1 and Codex
- Question: How should unannotated conditions be represented?
- Alternatives: assume negative; report-derived weak label; unknown mask.
- Evidence: Kaggle says only a small training subset has per-condition labels and supplies multilingual reports for possible label derivation.
- Decision: default to unknown masks. Weak labels require a versioned extraction protocol and validation before use.
- Risks: fewer supervised examples initially.
- Reversal condition: organizer-provided semantics or validated weak supervision supports a different treatment.
- Commit/experiment: `fdd9769`; no experiment.

## D-004 - No speculative remote write

- Date: 2026-08-07
- Owner: Codex
- Question: Create a private GitHub repository automatically?
- Alternatives: create now; use an existing repository; request the remote choice.
- Evidence: no matching private repository exists, the only private repository is unrelated, and the fine-grained token currently sees no private repositories.
- Decision: prepare the local feature branch and request approval for the new private remote.
- Risks: local work is not yet backed up remotely.
- Reversal condition: user approves a repository name or identifies an existing private repository.
- Commit/experiment: `fdd9769`; no experiment.

Outcome: the Chunk 1 instruction authorized creation. The new source-of-truth repository was created under `Luvi-1`, verified private, and added as `origin`; it was not merged.

## D-005 - Use uv with locked non-editable installs

- Date: 2026-08-07
- Owner: Codex
- Question: Which reproducible Python dependency workflow should govern local and CI execution?
- Alternatives: pip plus requirements files; Poetry; `uv` with `uv.lock`.
- Evidence: `uv` 0.11.29 is installed, supports exact direct bounds and locked syncs, and a non-editable install works with the current Python security behavior.
- Decision: use Python 3.11, exact direct dependencies, `uv.lock`, and `UV_NO_EDITABLE=1` for local and CI commands.
- Risks: future lock refreshes require deliberate dependency review.
- Reversal condition: `uv` becomes unsupported on Kaggle or cannot reproduce the approved environment.
- Commit/experiment: this Chunk 1 commit; `exp-0000-smoke`.

## D-006 - Use SQLite as the experiment and provenance registry

- Date: 2026-08-07
- Owner: Codex
- Question: What is the minimum durable registry for experiment contracts, results, metrics, and artifacts?
- Alternatives: SQLite; Parquet; both.
- Evidence: the records are relational and low volume; SQLite supplies constraints, foreign keys, and one portable private file without another dependency.
- Decision: use schema-versioned SQLite. Add Parquet only when aggregate analytics demonstrate a need.
- Risks: concurrent writers are not a current use case.
- Reversal condition: registry volume or concurrent analysis makes SQLite measurably inadequate.
- Commit/experiment: this Chunk 1 commit; `exp-0000-smoke`.

## D-007 - Keep one project-skill source with a discovery link

- Date: 2026-08-07
- Owner: Codex
- Question: How should the requested `.codex/skills` layout remain discoverable by a new Codex session?
- Alternatives: duplicate skills; use only `.agents/skills`; link the discovery path to the requested source.
- Evidence: current Codex documentation discovers repository skills from `.agents/skills`, while this chunk explicitly requires `.codex/skills`.
- Decision: keep authoritative skills in `.codex/skills` and expose them through the relative `.agents/skills` symlink.
- Risks: clients that do not follow repository symlinks may need direct `.agents/skills` files.
- Reversal condition: Codex natively discovers `.codex/skills` or a target environment rejects symlinks.
- Commit/experiment: this Chunk 1 commit; no experiment.

## D-008 - One canonical machine-readable competition contract

- Date: 2026-08-07
- Owner: Codex
- Question: How should code consume mutable competition constraints without duplicating them?
- Alternatives: hard-code values in modules; copy values across configs; one canonical contract plus
  a project pointer.
- Evidence: the prior validator duplicated the 12 targets, and official sources contain live drift
  and contradictions.
- Decision: keep all operational values in `docs/competition_contract/contract.yaml`, point to it
  from `configs/competition.yaml`, and require the submission validator and future Kaggle packaging
  to load that source.
- Risks: a stale canonical file remains possible if no live refresh occurs.
- Reversal condition: Kaggle publishes a stable, complete machine API contract that can be consumed
  directly and reproducibly.
- Commit/experiment: this Chunk 2 commit; no experiment.

## D-009 - Fail closed on official-source contradictions

- Date: 2026-08-07
- Owner: Codex
- Question: Which interpretation governs when official pages or incorporated terms disagree?
- Alternatives: use the newest wording; use the most permissive wording; apply source authority and
  the narrowest safe interpretation.
- Evidence: nine live contradictions affect slug, schema, asset access, derivative works,
  commercial use, public weights, winner licensing, institution count, and start-date semantics.
- Decision: binding Rules and MIRA outrank contextual pages; named license legal text controls its
  meaning; unresolved operational fields fail closed. Track every contradiction in a private issue.
- Risks: conservative defaults may delay an otherwise permitted action.
- Reversal condition: written Kaggle or RSNA clarification resolves the specific ambiguity.
- Commit/experiment: this Chunk 2 commit; no experiment.
